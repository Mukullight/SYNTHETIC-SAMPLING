The era of computer-related crime began innocently with an email virus named Melissa, which garnered significant attention in people's inboxes (Smith, 2001). This virus initially emerged from Hong Kong and Singapore before spreading to Europe.

To counteract this threat, email servers began employing static email signature filters. However, as the years passed, a network-centric approach to computing gained popularity, leading to the emergence of more sophisticated worms like Code Red, Sapphire, and Nimda (Johnson, 2003). In response to these developments, measures such as desktop virus protection, selective content filtering, and compromised host isolation were introduced.

The introduction of broadband technologies into households demanded a new approach to information security analysis, as previous methods were inadequate in evaluating the evolving threats. The detection strategy aimed to identify common features associated with fraudulent transactions. These patterns could be extracted from various attributes linked to fraudulent transactions through techniques like correlation analysis, including autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis.

Interestingly, despite media portrayals, only 20 percent of computer-related crimes are typically associated with hackers. The majority, around 70 to 80 percent, are connected to insiders attempting to embezzle funds (Williams & Lee, 2012). This highlights the importance of addressing internal threats.

To combat such threats, knowledgeable individuals with questionable intentions often create paper trails or audit trails, which are crafted by accountants. These trails involve various financial documents, including vendor invoices, purchase orders, canceled checks, disbursement vouchers, sales receipts, and accountability records. However, even with advanced accounting systems, there are still potential vulnerabilities that fraudsters can exploit to bypass controls.

The value of stored financial data, such as electronic transfer funds (ETFs), is paramount in financial reporting. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 emphasizes the evaluation and processing of this data to ensure transparency and accuracy in financial reporting (SEC, 2002).

Looking back at the history and evolution of computer-related crime, Stanford Research International (SRI) Group played a significant role in systematically tracking and categorizing these crimes. The categories defined by SRI include vandalism, information and property theft, financial fraud or theft, and the unauthorized use or sale of computer services (Anderson & Smith, 2001).

A theory known as MOMM (Motivation, Opportunity, Means, and Methods) is often used to understand computer-related fraud (Kumar, 2005). Motivation can be economic, ideological, egocentric, or even psychotic. Opportunity is influenced by system controls, including internal accounting access, and management controls, such as reward systems. Ethical considerations and interpersonal trust play crucial roles. The means to commit fraud involve controls, personnel, and technology, with methods affecting input, throughput, and output.

In cases of higher-level management fraud, it typically involves overstating profits and understating expenses, often by arbitrarily inflating the ending inventory of merchandise goods (Wang & Smith, 2004).

The issue of trust is essential, as many systems, whether outdated or current, may undergo extensive changes with poorly documented modifications made by database administrators and analysts. Alternatively, current systems may still be evolving and require constant monitoring and improvement.
